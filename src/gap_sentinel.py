"""AI gap-risk sentinel for HELD positions (2026-06-08).

WHY: a stop-loss cannot protect against an overnight GAP — when price jumps past
the stop, the stop becomes a market order and fills at the gapped price, not the
stop level. Monitoring more often doesn't help (there are no trades between the
stop and the gap; pre/post-market liquidity is thin). The ONLY effective defense
is to exit a known-catalyst name DURING regular hours, BEFORE the gap. Sizing
(MAX_POSITION_PCT) is the other real defense; this sentinel is the catalyst one.

Two layers, evaluated per held symbol each scan:

  Layer 1 — earnings (deterministic, high-value): if the name reports within
    GAP_EXIT_EARNINGS_DAYS, exit. Earnings is the biggest single-name gap source
    and the date is KNOWN, so no AI guess is needed. This is the reliable layer.

  Layer 2 — AI news (probabilistic, secondary, FAIL-SAFE): Gemini + Tavily judge
    fresh PUBLIC bad news (downgrade / lawsuit / guidance cut / sector shock) and
    sell only on a high-confidence verdict. It CANNOT foresee an earnings surprise
    (that's a coin-flip), and on any error/quota/doubt it HOLDS — a real position
    is never liquidated on AI uncertainty.

The caller (executor.manage_open_trades) does the actual _force_close + notify,
so every sentinel exit is visible (no silent execution).
