"""Approval queue — analyze → notify → APPROVE → execute. Feedback 铁律.

Automated analysis (weekly self-review, reconcile drift, blacklist, and a future
Anthropic-API background optimizer) NEVER changes live behavior silently. It
enqueues a suggestion here; the owner approves/rejects (GUI panel, or the
`approve`/`reject` CLI), and the scan loop applies APPROVED items via
apply_approved(). This is the single choke point that enforces "no silent
execution" — and the reserved mount point for the future autonomous optimizer
(it writes proposals here, never to the live config).
