"""Centralised "can we open new positions right now?" decision.

Used to live across three places:
  • main.py:  in_trade_phase() check at top of scan_once
  • main.py:  regime.block_new_entries check before candidate loop
  • risk_manager.can_open_new():  halted + drawdown checks

Each had different short-circuit shapes (return / continue / break), different
audit formats, and the daily-reset for `halted` only fired lazily from inside
can_open_new — which left a "ghost halt" if no candidate reached that stage.

This module pulls all four checks into one function so:
  1. The same logic runs at the same point in every scan.
  2. The audit gate name is consistent ("kill_switch").
  3. The GUI can read one snapshot ("can_trade", "reason") instead of guessing.
